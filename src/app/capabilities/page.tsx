                From design-build and ground-up construction to remodels &amp; additions, tenant improvements, public works delivery, pools &amp; outdoor living, and grading &amp; earthwork, the sections below outline what each capability includes, when it fits best, and how it influences budget, schedule, and coordination. Skim the headings to zero in on what matters most right now.

              <p>
                Choosing an approach early reduces risk, limits change orders, and keeps approvals moving. You&#39;ll see how permits and inspections are handled, what compliance involves (ADA, Title&nbsp;24, health department, fire/life safety, prevailing wage), how work proceeds in occupied spaces, and where key decisions shape cost and time. The result is a clear sense of process, realistic timelines, and the documentation you&#39;ll need to move forward with confidence.

                  With design-build, one team plans and builds your project. You get one point of contact and fewer hand-offs, which means fewer surprises. We check prices early and often so the design fits the budget, and we keep the schedule clear so work moves forward smoothly.
